// Devise a plan for solving problems
// Master common problem solving patterns0

// Frequency Counters
    // Pattern uses objects of sets to collect values/frequencies of values
    // This can often avoid the need for lested loops or O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings

    // write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has it's corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same
