// Objects are unordered, key value pairs
// Work well when we don't need order and fast access/insertion/removal
// Constant time for Insertion, removal, and access === or O(1);
// For searching, it is O(n) in linear time. 
// For Object.keys, Object.values, Object.entries the time complexity is O(N);
// while for hasOwnProperty, the time complexity is O(1)
